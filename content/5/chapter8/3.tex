The proposal \href{http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p0592r4.html}{P0592R4} gives only a rough idea of C++23 and concentrates on the main features. Features such as \href{ttps://www.modernescpp.com/index.php/task-blocks}{task blocks}, \href{https://www.modernescpp.com/index.php/the-end-of-the-detour-unified-futures}{unified futures}, \href{https://www.modernescpp.com/index.php/transactional-memory}{transactional memory}, or the \href{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/simd}{data-parallel vector library}, which supports \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD}{SIMD}, are not even mentioned. When you want more insight into the future of C++20, you have to study \href{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support}{cppreference.com/compiler\_support} or read the \href{http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/}{standardization committee papers} related to C++23.
