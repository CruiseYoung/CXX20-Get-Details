Whoever might think that a significant C++ standard is followed by a small C++ standard is wrong. C++23 will provide just as powerful extensions as C++20 does. Ville Voutilainen’s proposal \href{http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p0592r4.html}{P0592R4} “To boldly suggest an overall plan for C++23” gives a first idea of the upcoming C++23 standard. Ville names seven features.

\begin{itemize}
\item 
C++23
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Library support for coroutines

\item 
A modular standard library

\item 
Executors

\item 
Networking
\end{itemize}

\item 
C++23 or later
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Reflection

\item 
Pattern Matching

\item 
 Contracts
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The first four features are aimed for C++23, and the remaining three have no specific schedule. It is likely that reflection, pattern matching, and contracts are successively added to the C++ standards.
