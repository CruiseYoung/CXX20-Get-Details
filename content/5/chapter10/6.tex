A deadlock is a state in which at least one thread is blocked forever because it waits for the release of a resource that it will never get.

There are two main reasons for deadlocks:

\begin{enumerate}
\item 
A mutex has not been unlocked.

\item 
You lock your mutexes in an incorrect order.
\end{enumerate}
