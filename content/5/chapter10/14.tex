A binary operation (*) on some set X is

\begin{itemize}
\item 
associative, if it satisfies the associative law for all x, y, z in X: (x * y) * z = x * (y * z)

\item 
commutative, if it satisfies the commutative law for all x, y in X: x * y = y * x

\item 
distributive, if it satisfies the distributive law for all x, y, z in X: x(y + z) = xy + xz
\end{itemize}
