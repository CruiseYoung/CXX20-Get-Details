A callable unit (short callable) is something that behaves like a function. Not only are these named functions but also function objects or lambda expressions. If a callable accepts one argument, it’s called a unary callable, and with two arguments, it’s called a binary callable.

Predicates are special callables that return a boolean as a result.
