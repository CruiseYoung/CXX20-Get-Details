A race condition is a situation in which the result of an operation depends on the interleaving (ordering of operations) of certain individual operations.

Race conditions are quite difficult to spot. Whether they occur depends on the interleaving of the threads. That means the number of cores, the utilization of your system, or the optimization level of your executable may all be reasons why a race condition appears or does not.
