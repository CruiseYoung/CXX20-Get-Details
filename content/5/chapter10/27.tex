The Big Four are the four key features of C++20: concepts, modules, the ranges library, and coroutines.

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Concepts change the way we think about and program with templates. They are semantic categories for template parameters. They enable you to express your intention directly in the type system. If something goes wrong, the compiler gives you a clear error message.

\item 
Modules overcome the restrictions of header files. They promise a lot. For example, the separation of header and source files becomes as obsolete as the preprocessor. In the end, we have faster build times and an easier way to build packages.

\item 
The new ranges library supports performing algorithms directly on the containers, composing algorithms with the pipe symbol, and applying algorithms lazily on infinite data streams.

\item 
Thanks to coroutines, asynchronous programming in C++ becomes mainstream. Coroutines are the basis for cooperative tasks, event loops, infinite data streams, or pipelines.
\end{itemize}
