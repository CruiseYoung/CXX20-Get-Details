C++17 is neither a big nor a small C++ standard. It has two outstanding features: the parallel STL and the standardized filesystem API. About 80 algorithms of the Standard Template Library can be executed in parallel or vectorized. As with C++11, the boost libraries were highly influential for C++17. Boost provided the filesystem library and new data types: std::string\_view, std::optional, std::variant, and std::any.
