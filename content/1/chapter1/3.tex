In 2005, something exciting happened. The so-called Technical Teport 1 (TR1) was published. TR1 was a big step toward C++11 and, therefore, towards Modern C++. TR1 (TR 19768) is based on the \href{https://www.boost.org/}{Boost project}, which was founded by members of the C++ standardization committee. TR1 had 13 libraries that were destined to become part of the C++11 standard. For example, the regular expression library, the random number library, smart pointers and hashtables. Only the so-called special mathematical functions had to wait until C++17.
