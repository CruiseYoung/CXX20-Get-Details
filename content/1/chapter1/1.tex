At the end of the 80â€™s, Bjarne Stroustrup and Margaret A. Ellis wrote their famous book \href{https://www.stroustrup.com/arm.html}{Annotated C++ Reference Manual}(ARM). This book served two purposes, to define the functionality of C++ in a world with many implementations, and to provide the basis for the first C++ standard C++98 (ISO/IEC 14882). Some of the essential features of C++98 were: templates, the Standard Template Library (STL) with its containers, and algorithms, strings, and IO streams.
