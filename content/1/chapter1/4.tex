We call the C++11 standard Modern C++. The name Modern C++ is also used for C++14 and C++17. C++11 introduced many features that fundamentally changed the way we program in C++. For example, C++11 had the additions of TR1, but also move semantics, perfect forwarding, variadic templates, and constexpr. But that was not all. With C++11, we also got, for the first time, a memory model as the fundamental basis of threading and the standardization of a threading API.
